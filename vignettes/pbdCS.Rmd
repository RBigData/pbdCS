# Introduction

The **pbdCS** package [[@pbdCS]] is a set of utilities for interactively controlling batch, SPMD servers, such as those available in the **pbdR** [[@pbdR2012]] ecosystem of R packages.

The spmd servers are derived from the **remoter** [[@remoter]] server, and the pbdclient is identically a **remoter** client.  Communication is handled by **ZeroMQ** [[@zeromq]] via R package **pbdZMQ** [[@Chen2015pbdZMQpackage]].  Our use of pbdZMQ is specialized to client/server communications, but the package is very general.  For more details about **pbdZMQ** see the **pbdZMQ** package vignette [[@Chen2015pbdZMQvignette]].



## Installation
You can install the stable version from CRAN using the usual `install.packages()`:

```r
install.packages("pbdCS")
```

The development version is maintained on GitHub, and can easily be installed by any of the packages that offer installations from GitHub:

```r
### Pick your preference
devtools::install_github("RBigData/pbdCS")
ghit::install_github("RBigData/pbdCS")
remotes::install_github("RBigData/pbdCS")
```






# Using the pbdserver

## Background
**pbdCS** is heavily dependent on the **remoter** package.  You are strongly encouraged to familiarize yourself with it before proceeding.

To launch a pbdserver, you can use `pbdserver()` or `pbdSpawn()`.  More information about each is provided below.  Each function has several options which should look familiar to those familiar with **remoter**.  The `password`, `maxretry`, `secure`, `log`, `verbose`, and `showmsg` options are identical to those in `remoter::server`.  There are several key differences in the pbdserver, however.

First, there are two ports, `port` and `remote_port`.  The former is the port used for connections between rank 0 of the MPI ranks and the client.  The latter is used if the default `bcaster` is used, namely `zmq`.  If the other supported `bcaster` is used, namely `mpi`, then this argument is ignored.

For more information, see the Implementation Details section below.


## Launching
There are two ways to launch the servers: via `mpirun` from the shell, and via `pbdSpawn()` from R.  To do the former, issue

```bash
mpirun -np 2 Rscript -e "pbdserver()"
```

passing arguments to `pbdserver()` as usual.  To launch from R directly:

```r
pbdSpawn()
```

To use `pbdSpawn()` from the terminal, do not combine with `mpirun`.  Instead issue:

```bash
Rscript -e "pbdSpawn()"
```


## Connecting
Use `pbdCS::pbdclient()` or `remoter::client()` as when connecting to a **remoter** server.





# Implementation Details

When setting up the pbdservers, by default they will use ZeroMQ to communicate with each other.  So when a client connects and begins issuing commands, those are propagated from rank 0 to the other ranks via a push/pull ZeroMQ socket.  This can be changed to use MPI's `bcast()` by setting `bcaster=mpi` when setting up the pbdservers, but this is generally not recommended.  The ZeroMQ method should be sufficiently fast, but it does not busy wait for commands, which is a serious advantage in the interactive environment.

The above shows an example with a single input and its corresponding return return.  Here, the user enters `allreduce(1)` from **pbdMPI**, which will use communication between the SPMD servers to return the total number of servers running.  The client captures this input and passes it along to rank 0 of the SPMD servers.  Then, using the push/pull sockets, the client's message is broadcast from rank 0 to all other SPMD servers.  Finally, the command is evaluated, and the result from rank 0 is returned to the client.  This pattern assumes that the `bcaster` method used when setting up the servers was ZeroMQ.
