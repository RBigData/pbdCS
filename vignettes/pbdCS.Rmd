# Introduction

The **pbdCS** package [[@pbdCS]] ...

**pbdR** [[@pbdR2012]]

The spmd servers are derived from the **remoter** [[@remoter]] server, and the pbdclient is identically a **remoter** client.  Communication is handled by **ZeroMQ** [[@zeromq]] via R package **pbdZMQ** [[@Chen2015pbdZMQpackage]].  Our use of pbdZMQ is specialized to client/server communications, but the package is very general.  For more details about **pbdZMQ** see the **pbdZMQ** package vignette [[@Chen2015pbdZMQvignette]].



## Installation
You can install the stable version from CRAN using the usual `install.packages()`:

```r
install.packages("pbdCS")
```

The development version is maintained on GitHub.  You can install this version using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("RBigData/pbdCS")
```





# Using the pbdserver

## Background

TODO
remoter
The `password`, `maxretry`, `secure`, `log`, `verbose`, and `showmsg` options are identical to those in `remoter::server`.  There are several key differences in the pbdserver, however.

First, there are two ports, `port` and `remote_port`.

TODO
`bcaster`
For more information, see the Implementation Details section below.


## Launching
There are two ways to launch the servers: via `mpirun` from the shell, and via `pbdSpawn()` from R.  To do the former, issue

```bash
mpirun -np 2 Rscript -e "pbdserver()"
```

passing arguments to `pbdserver()` as usual.  To launch from R directly:

```r
pbdSpawn()
```

To use `pbdSpawn()` from the terminal, do not combine with `mpirun`.  Instead issue:

```bash
Rscript -e "pbdSpawn()"
```


## Connecting
Use `pbdCS::pbdclient()` or `remoter::client()` as when connecting to a **remoter** server.

The above shows an example with a single input and its corresponding return return.  Here, the user enters `allreduce(1)` from **pbdMPI**, which will use communication between the SPMD servers to return the total number of servers running.  The client captures this input and passes it along to rank 0 of the SPMD servers.  Then, using the push/pull sockets, the client's message is broadcast from rank 0 to all other SPMD servers.  Finally, the command is evaluated, and the result from rank 0 is returned to the client.  This pattern assumes that the `bcaster` method used when setting up the servers was `zmq`.  If `mpi` is chosen, then the push/pull communication is replaced by an MPI `bcast()` call.
