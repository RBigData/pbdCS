Title: 'pbdR' Client/Server Utilities
Version: 0.2-0
Description: A set of utilities for interactively using the 'pbdR' set
    of packages.  By design, 'pbdR' uses the Single Program/Multiple Data
    or 'SPMD' paradigm, which is inherently batch (non-interactive).
    The client/server allows for the use of interactively controlling
    batch 'SPMD' servers as one would a regular R session.  The
    communication between client and server is handled by 'ZeroMQ',
    and 'intra-server' communication of commands can be handled by 'ZeroMQ'
    or MPI (see vignette for details).
